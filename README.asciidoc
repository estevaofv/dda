== dda - Django Desktop Application

=== Introduction

DDA is an example project to demonstrate how to use Django as a desktop
application.  It provides an alternative to using a GUI framework such as
https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/tkinter.html[Tkinter] or
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/[PyQt].

It is a work in progress.
