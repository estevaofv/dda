== dda - Django Desktop Application

=== Introduction

DDA is an example project to demonstrate how to use Django as a desktop
application.  It provides an alternative to using a GUI framework such as
https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/tkinter.html[Tkinter] or
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/[PyQt].

It is a work in progress.

=== Credits

To allow the Django Desktop Application to access common javascript and css
files used by the web pages (without having to hit the network), I have
included copies in this distribution.  Here is a list:

 - http://jquery.com/[jQuery (Version 2.1.1)]
 - http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap (Version 3.3.1)]
 - http://glyphicons.com/[Glyphicons] (Graciously donated to Bootstrap)
 - http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/[Bootstrap Select (Version 1.6.3)]

They are all awesome.
